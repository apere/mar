                | As Program Coordinator for SEED Academy, I support and foster the learning of 90 secondary students grades 9-12. To this end, to ensure that best practices in teaching and student engagement are being exercised, I have created and facilitate a professional development program for a teaching staff of 20. Additionally, I steer the development of pedagogy and curriculum toward an integrated, experiential and project based program model and foster relationships with educators, CBOs and community stakeholders in Cambridge, Lawrence and Boston.

                | Additionally, I am charged with developing strategies for recruiting students from under-resourced and under-represented populations, supporting both staff and student evaluations and fostering working relationships with staff, faculty, students and the greater MIT community.

                | As Programming Director, I created a community of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty to foster the development of women in the sciences, and organized panels and forums to raise awareness about and address the issues women in science face. I forged a partnership with Brandeisâ€™ Graduate Career Services Office to extend the reach of Professional Development Programming to the Sciences. I conceived of the Art of Science Series to broaden the interdisciplinary scope of the Initiative and to make Science more broadly accessible to people from diverse disciplines. I also assisted in securing two dedicated lactation rooms and hospital-grade lactation pump for community members not covered by the Affordable Care Act.
