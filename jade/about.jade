        p
          | Basic science exists as a language and a culture all its own. I am a translator and a cultural ambassador. I am a quick learner who possesses strong analytic skills, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for developing new skills and meeting new people. I am fortunate to work in an environment in which I'm exposed to the broad applications of STEM. I am familiar with research and literature in an array of disciplines within the life sciences. I am passionate about communicating science and increasing entry points to educational access especially to under-resourced populations. I look forward to leveraging my scientific training to promote scientific literacy and shape the future of scientific innovation.
